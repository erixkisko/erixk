Alright, serious(ish) prediction time: I think the next Pope could be **Pierbattista Pizzaballa**.

Yes, that's his real name. No, I didn’t make it up.  
Yes, he’s a cardinal. No, this isn't an elaborate Pizza Hut ad campaign.

Sure, he's got some pretty conservative views, but let’s be honest — **the name alone could unite the world**.  
Say it out loud: **Pope Pizzaballa**. Feels warm. Feels carby. Feels like hope.

Imagine the headlines:

- _Pizzaballa calls for extra topping of mercy_
- _Pizzaballa hosts peace summit with crusty optimism_
- _Vatican denies rumors of pineapple schism_

Would the world be more peaceful? Probably not. But funnier? Absolutely.

🕊️🍕 Let’s manifest it.
