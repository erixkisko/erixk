Beavers don’t just build dams. They **literally re-engineer landscapes**, create habitats for other species, and fight climate change by slowing erosion and filtering water.

They're the **unsung eco-heroes** of North America, with teeth so strong they can chew through trees. Oh, and their tails? Built-in floaties.
